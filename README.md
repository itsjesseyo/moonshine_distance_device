# moonshine_distance_device
IOS app for reading distance via my homebrew BLE LIDAR device

This was a quick hack to get a distance in centimeters form the rfduino, and to auto select the device when available.Very minimal changes form the original code provided by RFDuino.

There are also files for the laser cut palstic piece to mount everything to.

Lastly, a simple arduino project to make the rfduino function is included.

Feel free to reach out with questions.
